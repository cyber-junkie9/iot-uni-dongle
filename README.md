## Main goals

1. Unified design for all types of home devices from different manufacturers.
2. Use of various connectors with a pitch of 2.54 mm and USB.
3. Possibility of swapping the middle signal TX/RX contacts.
4. IR transmission and receiving via one wire connected to TSOP output.
5. Minimalistic design: 30.5x19mm (PCB size: 23.5x19mm).
6. Using popular Wi-Fi module [ESP12-F](https://docs.ai-thinker.com/_media/esp8266/docs/esp-12f_product_specification_en.pdf) based on ESP8266 SoC.

## Some sockets mounting examples

## Signal lines TX/RX

To select the location of the signal contacts, it is necessary to close the jumper platforms with drops of solder (in the photos is marked in red). Signal lines are named according to the master, that is, ESP12-F.

## Sending and receiving IR remote control commands

Due to the fact that not all capabilities are implemented in the UART protocol (for example, indication control and `FollowMe` feature), it is possible to sending IR commands by supplying a demodulated signal (duty: 100%) to pin `GPIO13`.
To do this, connect the `IR-` pad located on the top side of the stick and the output of the TSOP IR demodulator on the display board.
The pictures below show an example for a `TSOP1738` IR receiver.

You can also read the IR signal on the `GPIO12` pin from all remote controls, including third party ones. It can help in researching protocols and various automation goals without resorting to additional devices, thus saving energy.

## SMT assembly on JLCPCB

The [single-smt](jlcpcb/single-smt) directory contains the files necessary for manufacturing and assembling the board at the [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) factory.

That is, the received order will look like this:

You just have to solder the module and the required connector on the back of the board and select the position of the signal contacts depending on your device.

## Frequently asked Questions:
> How can I flash my stick?

I've written some [tutorial](FLASHING.md). Read it.

> How can I tell if my air conditioner is supported or not?

*None 100% answer to the question. But there is a high probability of support if your air conditioner has a USB connector, a regular place for a stick, UART is used.*

> What firmware would you recommend?

*Initially, the stick was developed for [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) and [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io), but it is possible to write your own firmware for your tasks and needs if you have the appropriate skills.*
